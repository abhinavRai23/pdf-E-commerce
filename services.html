                                    <p>The content development of teaching and learning resources has always been
                                        integral to education and training and largely the domain of teachers. Several
                                        factors have led to an increased emphasis on content development now as a
                                        separate and more specialised activity, and often involving a consultative
                                        approach or team effort or undertaken by people who may or may not be involved
                                        in the teaching. Some of the reasons for this relate to the particular nature
                                        of content, for example:</p>

                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Good teaching and learning involve various forms of interactivity and
                                            consideration needs to be given to how to effectively design and develop
                                            the resources that make best use of study material, have the right blend of
                                            activities, and are motivational, accessible, and effective educationally.</li>
                                        <li>Communication and interaction between students are an important part of
                                            effective learning and this again has implications for content development
                                            and may need the involvement of special expertise to build this
                                            successfully into learning content.</li>
                                        <li>Content development projects typically involve team members from a variety
                                            of organisations, and this increases the need for more formal
                                            methodologies.</li>
                                    </ul>

                                    <p>There are also changes which are not just specific to content, but increase the
                                        need for more formal approaches to content development (i.e. involve greater
                                        project planning, liaison with others, greater need to fit with external
                                        criteria, and so forth). Processes and steps in Content Development</p>

                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Establishing the assessment criteria and methods by which students will
                                            demonstrate skills, attributes, and understanding (at stages within the
                                            learning as well as at the conclusion). Time spent exploring options here
                                            can open up many more ideas for presenting content and is more likely to
                                            produce meaningful and integrated assessment embedded within learning
                                            activities.</li>
                                        <li>Mapping and then sequencing the key elements of the content.</li>
                                        <li>Applying instructional design effective for choosing appropriate teaching
                                            strategies; presentation considerations; and building in scaffolding that
                                            will support the learners move to independent thinking as they become more
                                            familiar with the topic and the medium which is very important to do when
                                            learners are not in a face-to-face situation.</li>
                                        <li>Deciding which is key content, and needs reinforcement, what material can
                                            become secondary links, and which comes under the heading of supplementary
                                            or additional learning resources.</li>
                                        <li>Doing a walk-through and check on time allocations for each learning
                                            activity (including reading); congruence between assessment and learning
                                            objectives and learning content and learning tasks; clarity; and
                                            completeness.</li>

                                        choose to handle their own legal or tax matters, but many do not realize the
                                        risks that they face when they choose to handle their own graphic design. A

                                        many problems arise like delays and increased cost. You can use our experience
                                        to avoid those types of problems.</p>
                                    <p>We want our clients to know we can look after their marketing requirements from
                                        “start to finish”. We work alongside you to help you grow your client base and
                                        sales, to make your business both successful and profitable. Together, we can

                                        Numerous eBook formats emerged and proliferated, some supported by major
                                        software companies such as Adobe with its PDF format, and others supported by
                                        independent and open-source programmers. Multiple readers followed multiple
                                        formats, most of them specializing in only one format, and thereby fragmenting
                                        the eBook market even more. Due to exclusiveness and limited readerships of
                                        eBooks, the fractured market of independent publishers and specialty authors
                                        lacked consensus regarding a standard for packaging and selling eBooks.

                                    <p>The content development of teaching and learning resources has always been
                                        integral to education and training and largely the domain of teachers. Several
                                        factors have led to an increased emphasis on content development now as a
                                        separate and more specialised activity, and often involving a consultative
                                        approach or team effort or undertaken by people who may or may not be involved
                                        in the teaching. Some of the reasons for this relate to the particular nature
                                        of content, for example:</p>

                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Good teaching and learning involve various forms of interactivity and
                                            consideration needs to be given to how to effectively design and develop
                                            the resources that make best use of study material, have the right blend of
                                            activities, and are motivational, accessible, and effective educationally.</li>
                                        <li>Communication and interaction between students are an important part of
                                            effective learning and this again has implications for content development
                                            and may need the involvement of special expertise to build this
                                            successfully into learning content.</li>
                                        <li>Content development projects typically involve team members from a variety
                                            of organisations, and this increases the need for more formal
                                            methodologies.</li>
                                    </ul>

                                    <p>There are also changes which are not just specific to content, but increase the
                                        need for more formal approaches to content development (i.e. involve greater
                                        project planning, liaison with others, greater need to fit with external
                                        criteria, and so forth). Processes and steps in Content Development</p>

                                            can open up many more ideas for presenting content and is more likely to
                                            produce meaningful and integrated assessment embedded within learning

                                        Numerous eBook formats emerged and proliferated, some supported by major
                                        software companies such as Adobe with its PDF format, and others supported by
                                        independent and open-source programmers. Multiple readers followed multiple
                                        formats, most of them specializing in only one format, and thereby fragmenting
                                        the eBook market even more. Due to exclusiveness and limited readerships of
                                        eBooks, the fractured market of independent publishers and specialty authors
                                        lacked consensus regarding a standard for packaging and selling eBooks.
