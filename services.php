                                <p>The content development of teaching and learning resources has always been
                                    integral to education and training and largely the domain of teachers. Several
                                    factors have led to an increased emphasis on content development now as a
                                    separate and more specialised activity, and often involving a consultative
                                    approach or team effort or undertaken by people who may or may not be involved
                                    in the teaching. Some of the reasons for this relate to the particular nature
                                    of content, for example:</p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>Good teaching and learning involve various forms of interactivity and
                                        consideration needs to be given to how to effectively design and develop
                                        the resources that make best use of study material, have the right blend of
                                        activities, and are motivational, accessible, and effective educationally.</li>
                                    <li>Communication and interaction between students are an important part of
                                        effective learning and this again has implications for content development
                                        and may need the involvement of special expertise to build this
                                        successfully into learning content.</li>
                                    <li>Content development projects typically involve team members from a variety
                                        of organisations, and this increases the need for more formal
                                        methodologies.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>There are also changes which are not just specific to content, but increase the
                                    need for more formal approaches to content development (i.e. involve greater
                                    project planning, liaison with others, greater need to fit with external
                                    criteria, and so forth). Processes and steps in Content Development</p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>Establishing the assessment criteria and methods by which students will
                                        demonstrate skills, attributes, and understanding (at stages within the
                                        learning as well as at the conclusion). Time spent exploring options here
                                        can open up many more ideas for presenting content and is more likely to
                                        produce meaningful and integrated assessment embedded within learning
                                        activities.</li>
                                    <li>Mapping and then sequencing the key elements of the content.</li>
                                    <li>Applying instructional design effective for choosing appropriate teaching
                                        strategies; presentation considerations; and building in scaffolding that
                                        will support the learners move to independent thinking as they become more
                                        familiar with the topic and the medium which is very important to do when
                                        learners are not in a face-to-face situation.</li>
                                    <li>Deciding which is key content, and needs reinforcement, what material can
                                        become secondary links, and which comes under the heading of supplementary
                                        or additional learning resources.</li>
                                    <li>Doing a walk-through and check on time allocations for each learning
                                        activity (including reading); congruence between assessment and learning
                                        objectives and learning content and learning tasks; clarity; and
                                        completeness.</li>
                                </ul>

                                    Numerous eBook formats emerged and proliferated, some supported by major

                                    independent and open-source programmers. Multiple readers followed multiple
                                    formats, most of them specializing in only one format, and thereby fragmenting
                                    the eBook market even more. Due to exclusiveness and limited readerships of
                                    eBooks, the fractured market of independent publishers and specialty authors
                                    lacked consensus regarding a standard for packaging and selling eBooks.

                                <p>The content development of teaching and learning resources has always been
                                    integral to education and training and largely the domain of teachers. Several
                                    factors have led to an increased emphasis on content development now as a
                                    separate and more specialised activity, and often involving a consultative
                                    approach or team effort or undertaken by people who may or may not be involved
                                    in the teaching. Some of the reasons for this relate to the particular nature
                                    of content, for example:</p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>Good teaching and learning involve various forms of interactivity and
                                        consideration needs to be given to how to effectively design and develop
                                        the resources that make best use of study material, have the right blend of
                                        activities, and are motivational, accessible, and effective educationally.</li>
                                    <li>Communication and interaction between students are an important part of
                                        effective learning and this again has implications for content development
                                        and may need the involvement of special expertise to build this
                                        successfully into learning content.</li>
                                    <li>Content development projects typically involve team members from a variety
                                        of organisations, and this increases the need for more formal
                                        methodologies.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>There are also changes which are not just specific to content, but increase the
                                    need for more formal approaches to content development (i.e. involve greater
                                    project planning, liaison with others, greater need to fit with external
                                    criteria, and so forth). Processes and steps in Content Development</p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>Establishing the assessment criteria and methods by which students will
                                        demonstrate skills, attributes, and understanding (at stages within the
                                        learning as well as at the conclusion). Time spent exploring options here
                                        can open up many more ideas for presenting content and is more likely to
                                        produce meaningful and integrated assessment embedded within learning

                                    which is our specialty. Most people understand the risks they face when they
                                    choose to handle their own legal or tax matters, but many do not realize the

                                    Numerous eBook formats emerged and proliferated, some supported by major
                                    software companies such as Adobe with its PDF format, and others supported by
                                    independent and open-source programmers. Multiple readers followed multiple
                                    formats, most of them specializing in only one format, and thereby fragmenting
                                    the eBook market even more. Due to exclusiveness and limited readerships of
                                    eBooks, the fractured market of independent publishers and specialty authors
                                    lacked consensus regarding a standard for packaging and selling eBooks.
